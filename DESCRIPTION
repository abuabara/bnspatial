Description: Package for the spatial implementation and mapping of Bayesian Networks in geographical space. 
    It makes maps of expected value (or most likely state) given known and unknown conditions, maps of uncertainty 
    measured as both coefficient of variation or Shannon index (entropy), maps of probability associated to any states 
    of any node of the network. Some additional features are provided as well, such as parallel processing options,
    data discretization routines and function wrappers designed for users with minimal knowledge of the R programming language.
