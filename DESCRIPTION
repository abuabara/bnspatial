Description: bnspatial is a package designed to facilitate the spatial implementation 
	of BN with minimal knowledge of the R programming language. It consists mainly of 
	function wrappers allowing the creation of spatial data from BN easily and 
	efficiently, but offers some additional features too, including powerful parallel 
	processing options and data discretization routines.
