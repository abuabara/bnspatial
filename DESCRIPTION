Description: bnspatial is a package designed to facilitate the spatial
    implementation of BN with minimal knowledge of the R programming language. It
    consists mainly of function wrappers allowing the creation of spatial data from
    BN easily and efficiently, but offers some additional features too, including
    powerful parallel processing options and data discretization routines.
